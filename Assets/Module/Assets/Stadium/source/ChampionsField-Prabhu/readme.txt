Hi.

About the textures and shaders:

Please note that this model was done for a lookdev in Unreal Engine. As a result of that, this model has reasonably good applications of material IDs to the individual meshes and faces, however it lacks proper naming conventions and it would be difficult for you to assign relevant textures.
You can refer my film here - https://youtu.be/jihYkbJQtH0 to understand which texture is sitting on which mesh.
